# Portfolio

Several R and Python projects can be found under the Regis folder.  They are organized by class.  
  
A word document containing SQL statements and output is under the SQL folder.  
I'm unable to share SQL projects from work due to confidentiality reasons so I created a SQLLite database from a dataset of Google App Store data found on Kaggle.com.
